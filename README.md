# NFL_Quarterback_Model

## An overall look at the 2025 rookie QB class

Before we get into the comps, let's get a general sense of the overall strength of the 2025 NFL rookie quarterback class. This swarmplot falls in line with the general consensus that this is not a great quarterback class. The green dots represent every quarterback in the dataset that the model was trained on. These are quarterbacks whose careers began in 2005 or later. QB_score is our target variable. That's explained in more detail in the notebooks. The red dots represent the top 14 rookie quarterbacks, without names for now.<br>

With this in mind, we know that we shouldn't expect any of these rookies to be compared to any great quarterbacks who have played in the NFL.
